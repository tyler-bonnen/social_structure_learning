# `MOTIVATION AND CONCLUSIONS:`

Animal behavior is shaped through social experience; often adaptively, at times unknowingly, our life among others guides our relationship with the world around us. Within the animal kingdom, **`social conditioning`** is among the most ancient forms of social learning: social cues from a conspecific (e.g. bodliy responses, vocalizations) are thought to provide a teaching signal, one that enables observers to learn the value of environmental stimuli. Observers in these situations have been shown to undergo the same well-characterized learning trajectories that are implicated in first-person conditioning, and to recruit the same neural systems. 

`((( words about why understanding renewal is important : memory, trauma )))` 

Here we demonstrate the first experimental evidence that animals who undergo social conditioning demonstrate **`renewal`**. We use both self-report and physiological measures in a two-day study. We then replicate these findings in a second study and ask what patterns of attention predict these physiological responses, using eyetracking measures. Contrary to prevailing theories of emotion, we find that attention to causal relationships (not faces) predict physiological measures of learning and renewal. This form of `social structure learning` is not predicted implicit attentional measures, not by trait- or state-based self-reported measures.


# `MAIN FINDINGS ACROSS TWO STUDIES:`

We operationalize two physiological correlates of social learning during a: "emotional contagion" and "predictive learning". Emotional contagion is the differential Skin Conductance Response (SCR) subjects demonstrate when observing a conspecific being shocked (i.e. response to a socially aversive event). Predictive learning is the differential response subjects show to the conditioned stimulus itself, in anticipation of an aversive event.  

The main finding in this study is the continuous relationship between predictive learning with renewal (r=.35, p<.005). Emotional contagion on day one, however, was not predictive of renewal (r=-.06, p<.8).

In order to ask "What attentional measures predict this phenomena?" we replicate our original findings in a second cohort:

  <img style='width:100%' src="figures/day_two_scr_comparision.png">
</p>

In this second cohort we find several self report and attantional measures across both days of the study that covary with the magnitude of renewal: the amount of pain subjects report feeling at experiencing the shock themselves (```self_pain```), trait-level personal distress (```personal_distress```) as measured by the IRI, and a single looking behavior, attending to the model's wrist at the time of the US (```US_onset_wrist```):

### `RELATING ATTENTIONAL, EMPATHIC, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES:`

Faces play a prominent role in theories of emotional learning. We find that looking at faces during shock covaries with self-report measures of interest: 

<p align="center">
  <img style='width:100%' src="figures/faces_and_self_report.png">
</p>

Yet these face looking behaviors do not predict any physiological measures of interest on either days of the study:

  <img style='width:100%' src="figures/faces_and_physio.png">
</p>

Surprisingly, a number of self-report measures of empathic concern also do not predict our physiological measures:

### `A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE PHYSIOLOGY`


In study one, we look at the renewal behaviors for subjects who showed differential emotional contagion measures on day one, across different statistical threshholds. It does not appear that emotional contagion is a predictor of renewal at any statistical threshold: 

<p align="center">
  <img style='width:100%' src="figures/segmentation_analyis_contagion_study_one.png">
</p>

Across the same thresholds, however, it appears that subjects who showed differential predictive learning on day one, showed significant renewal effects on day two. This is true across as range of statistical thresholds: 
 
<p align="center">
  <img style='width:100%' src="figures/segmentation_analyis_prediction_study_one.png">
</p>


In study two, within a smaller cohort, we replicate this pattern of physiological data. Again, emotional contagion to the social US on day one do not predict renewal on day two: 

<p align="center">
  <img style='width:100%' src="figures/segmentation_analyis_contagion_study_two.png">
</p>

While there were no subjects who showed significantly differentially predictive learning, on day one, but looking across different statistical threshholds we observe the same pattern as in study one:

</p>


#### `VALIDATING AFFECTIVE INDUCTION WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND SELF REPORT MEASURES:`

As a validation of experimental protocol, we can show that subjects differentially respond to observing a social "unconditioned stimulus" (US), whis we operationalize as a demonstrator's expression of pain in response to an electric shock. This pattern holds across both experiments: 
 
<p align="center">
  <img style='width:40%' src="figures/study_one_first_us.png">
</p>


We can also look at the induction of emotion, as measured by self report, in response to these socially aversive stimuli. The self-reported pain (`post_selfPain`) that subjects experienced while watching the demonstrator throughout the experiment covaries with other phychological measures of interst: the amount of pain subjects thought the demonstrator felt (`post_otherPain`), the degree to which subject's felt like they could relate to the demonstrator (`post_relate`), as well as the degree to which subjects felt that they were similar to the demonstrator (`post_similar`).

<p align="center">
  <img style='width:80%' src="figures/study_one_post_selfPain.png">
</p>

There were also significant relationships between how aversive subjects rated a personal experience with an electrical shock (`pre_aversive`) with subjective reports of pain for both themselves (`post_selfPain`) and the demonstrator (`post_otherPain`) during conditioning. There was also a significant relationship between the voltage that subjects chose to administer to themselves (`pre_voltage`) with how much pain they reported experience while watching the demonstrator (`post_selfPain`); interestingly, this was an inverse relationship such that subjects who self-administered shock at a lower voltage reported feeling greater pain observing the demonstrator being shocked (`post_selfPain`). 

<p align="center">
  <img style='width:80%' src="figures/study_one_shock_relationships.png">
</p>

Similary, we can show that only those subjects who report believing that the demonstrator was actually being shocked, on day one, reported expecting that they would be shocked on day two:

<p align="center">
  <img style='width:40%' src="figures/day_one_expectation_and_belief.png">
</p>

These self report measures, however, do not appear to predict renewal on day two, in either study one or study two.

# `PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES:`

Our first measure, **`contagion learning`**, makes explicit a common assumption in the emotional literature: that a social cue (e.g. facial experession) can act as an "unconditioned stimulus", much like a direct experience with a stressor (e.g. electrical shock), providing a teaching signal for learning about the environment through the experience of conspecifics. For social fear conditioning, for example, it has been shown that these stimuli recruit many of the same neural mechanisms necessary for conditioning to a direct US, and undergo the same well characterized learning trajectories. 

If this is indeed the mechanisms for social learning, subjects who show differential skin conductance responses to the US (occuring at six CS+ offsets) should be those subjects that have learned the CS-US pairing. 

Conversely, if social learning occurs via the same mechanisms in place for first person experience, we would expect that learning on day one would be best characterized by subjects' differential skin conductance response to the CS+ at on ***onset*** of CS presentation. For clarity, we refer to this measure of learning as **`predictive learning`**.
