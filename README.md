# `social_structure_learning`

Animal behavior is shaped through social experience; often adaptively, at times unknowingly, our experiences with others guide our relationship with the world around us. In **`social conditioning`**, cues from a conspecific (e.g. bodliy responses, vocalizations) are thought to provide a teaching signal enabling observers to learn about the value of environmental stimuli (e.g. the taste of food, the temperature of an object). Employing self-report, physiological, and attentional measures in a two-day study, here we present the first experimental evidence that mammals demonstrate fear renewal after undergoing social fear conditioning; after undergoing social conditioning and then extinction on day one, subjects nonetheless demonstrate a spontaneous fear response when presented with the conditioned stimuli on day two. Interestingly, these results are predicted by implicit measures of attention, not subjective experiences, and---contrary to prevailing theories of emotion---we find that attention to causal relationships, not faces, predicts physiological measures. We argue `a)` that observers learn about environmental structure through social observation, not simply pairwise relationship between items, and `b)` this form of **`social structure learning`** recruits implicit, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms implicated in healthy and pathological emotional experience.
